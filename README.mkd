Setting up Madek with Ansible
=============================

**ATTENTION**: Checkout the `madek-v3` branch to deploy to testing. Unintended
(bad) things can happen if you don't keep the submodules in sync when switching
branches. It is probably wise to check out the madek-v3 in a different location.

Step by step procedure
----------------------

### Create your hosts configuration file

The easiest way is to copy the provided `hosts_demo` file:

    cp hosts_demo hosts

Adjust the value of the ansible_ssh_host variable therein with the ip of your
madek server. If the ip is 10.0.0.1 the line should read:

    madek-host ansible_ssh_host=10.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_user=root


### Install or Upgrade Madek

    ansible-playbook  -i hosts play_setup-and-deploy.yml

### Create a Admin User and set the Password

    ansible-playbook -i hosts play_create-admin.yml -e 'admin_password=YOUR-SECRETE-PASSWORD'



Customization and Advanced Topics
---------------------------------

### Resetting the Data from Production `test.madek`

Resetting the data from the last production dump is conditional and needs to
explicitly requested, e.g.:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts_zhdk-test play_setup-and-deploy.yml -e 'reset_data=True'

Be aware:

* Running the migrations, and hence the whole deploy, will take more than 2 hours.
* Resetting the data is required if migrations are mutated.


### Configure the Color Scheme

Madek comes with 4 predefined color schemes: green, red, blue and mono. The
color scheme can be configured by setting the `color_scheme` variable.
You can also set a `custom_color` variable to a valid CSS color, which will
override the main color *on top of* the chosen scheme.

This is most conveniently performed in the variables file for your specific host.
See `host_vars/test-vm` for example.


### Configure Zencoder

Set the `zencoder_enabled` variable in your host file to `True`, and
the `zencoder_test_mode` to your desired value (probably `False`).

    zencoder_enabled: True
    zencoder_test_mode: False

Keep these parameters in the hosts file. Run the setup-and-deploy play
with an additional parameter specifying your zencoder api-key:

    ansible-playbook  -i hosts play_setup-and-deploy.yml -e 'zencoder_api_key=YOUR-ZENCODER-API-KEY'

Note: The *setup-and-deploy* playbook will remember the
`zencoder_api_key`. There is no need to specify it again when the
setup-and-deploy playbook will be run in the future, to upgrade your
madek installation e.g.


### Configure Newrelic Application Monitoring

Perform the following once:

    ansible-playbook  -i hosts play_setup-and-deploy.yml -e 'newrelic_key=YOUR-NEWRELIC-KEY'
