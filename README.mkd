Setting up Madek with Ansible
=============================

**WORK IN PROGRESS** The deploy scripts are being rewritten for Madek version 3.

Step by step procedure
----------------------

### Checkout / Upgrade the Master-Project

Checkout the Madek master-project `https://github.com/Madek/madek` including
submodules (recursively). See either Initial Checkout or Upgrading below.

Descend into the `deploy` directory and continue with configuration of the
inventory.

#### Initial Checkout

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Madek/madek.git

#### Upgrading

The version which is going to be deployed is exactly the one that is checked
out in the master-project. So the master-project must be updated to upgrade
you installation of Madek. From within the master-project:

    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive

It is possible to run into troubles if the submodule structure has changed. The
following command might help. Backup your changes beforehand!

    git reset --hard origin/master && git clean --force -fd
    git submodule foreach --recursive 'git reset --hard HEAD && git clean --force -fdâ€™

You can as well start from scratch.


### Create your hosts configuration file

** THIS IS OUTDATED**
TODO

This and all the following steps are carried out from within the `deploy`
subdirectory.

The easiest way is to copy the provided `hosts_demo` file:

    cp hosts_demo my_hosts

Within the file `my_host` replace the word `demo` with `my_host` and adjust the
value of the ansible_ssh_host variable  ip of your madek server. If the ip is
10.0.0.1 the line should read:

    my_host ansible_ssh_host=10.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_user=root


### Install or Upgrade Madek

    ansible-playbook -i my_hosts play_setup-and-deploy.yml -e 'madek_master_secret=REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-SECRET'


### Create a Admin User and set the Password

    ansible-playbook -i my_hosts play_create-admin.yml -e 'admin_password=YOUR-SECRETE-PASSWORD'

This will create (or update) a user with the login `admin` and the given
password.


Customization and Advanced Topics
---------------------------------

### The `madek_master_secret`

The setup generates a default `madek_master_secret` based on various properties
of the target host and your application. These properties might be guessable or
not, depending on the setup of your host. It is highly recommended to override
the generated secret as shown in the invocations above.

Alternatives to the command line arguments are variables defined in the Ansible
Inventory. This is convenient in particular in conjunction with the [Ansible
Vault].

Caveat: the [Ansible rules of precedence] should be understood when proceeding
in this manner. At any rate, invoking

    ansible-playbook -i my_hosts play_info.yml --vault-password-file inventories/zhdk/vault-pass

(possibly with augmented arguments) will show the actual used values and
is recommended to be consulted for confirmation.

### Creating and Fetching Database Dumps

Example:

    ansible-playbook -i inventories/zhdk/staging-v3-pdata play_dump-and-fetch-data.yml


This will dump and fetch `data` as well as `structure_and_data` into
`tmp/{{ansible_host_name}}/tmp/` . Override `dump_items` to fetch only either
of them.

From the datalayer directory (of the webapp) a restore would look like the
following example:

    rake db:pg:truncate_tables db:pg:data:restore FILE=../../../deploy/tmp/staging-v3-pdata/tmp/madek_data.pgbin
